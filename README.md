### Project Description: Interfacing a DHT Sensor with Arduino for Temperature and Humidity Monitoring

In this project, you'll learn how to interface a DHT sensor (DHT11 or DHT22) with an Arduino to measure temperature and humidity. The data collected from the sensor will be displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen or output to the Serial Monitor for real-time monitoring. This project is ideal for beginners looking to explore sensor integration, data acquisition, and basic display methods in embedded systems.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- **Sensor Interfacing:** Learn how to connect and read data from a DHT sensor using an Arduino.
- **Data Processing:** Understand how to handle sensor data, including temperature and humidity values.
- **Output Display:** Display the sensor readings on a 16x2 LCD screen for easy visualization or use the Serial Monitor for direct output.

### Components Used:
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- DHT11 or DHT22 sensor (for measuring temperature and humidity)
- 16x2 LCD display (optional, for displaying the readings)
- 10kΩ potentiometer (for adjusting LCD contrast)
- Resistor (4.7kΩ for DHT sensor)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

### Circuit Layout:
The DHT sensor is connected to the Arduino for reading temperature and humidity values. The optional 16x2 LCD screen is used to display these readings. The project involves setting up the sensor and LCD connections correctly and writing code to read and display data.

### Code Overview:
The Arduino code initializes the DHT sensor, reads the temperature and humidity data, and then displays this information either on an LCD screen or the Serial Monitor. The program loops every few seconds to provide updated readings.

### Applications:
This project can be used in weather stations, environmental monitoring systems, or any application where tracking temperature and humidity is essential. It also serves as a foundational exercise in sensor integration and data handling in embedded systems.

This task offers practical experience with hardware-software integration and lays the groundwork for more complex Arduino projects involving multiple sensors and data displays.
